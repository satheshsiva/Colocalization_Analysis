# Results
The Approximate Bayes Factor (ABF) colocalization analysis revealed strong evidence for colocalization in the regions of rs4311 and rs1385742. The posterior probability for H4 (indicating a shared causal variant) was high for both of these regions.

| **SNP**    | **H0**    | **H1**    | **H2**   | **H3**   | **H4**   |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| rs4311     | 9.83E-68  | 1.35E-65  | 2.03E-04 | 2.69E-02 | 9.73E-01 |
| rs1385742  | 1.60E-18  | 2.32E-13  | 6.80E-08 | 8.85E-03 | 9.91E-01 |

| rs12151021 | 4.74E-31  | 2.31E-24  | 2.06E-07 | 1.00E+00 | 9.58E-06 |

The analysis also identified the specific SNPs that are likely associated with both traits in the rs4311 and rs1385742 regions. The highest posterior probability was found for rs1385742 as the shared causal variant.
